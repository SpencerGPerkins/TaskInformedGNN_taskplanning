# Task-informed Graph Neural Network for Assembly Task Planning
## _This repository currently only contains the code for running inference within the whole system pipeline_

All Code except the inference script and configuration is packaged in the GNN directory.
To run, be sure that a directory titled 'run_data' is created that has subfolders 'vision', and 'llm' within.
Run inference is essentially a standalone function to be placed within a larger main script.
